# DSH Dev Docs and the dsh-skill mirror

We publish the full-stack DSH plugin authoring guide — the `dsh-plugin-dev` skill — as **DSH Dev Docs**, a `/dsh` section of the BotHarness docs site, and distribute it through a standalone mirror repo, `BotHarness/dsh-skill`, so external developers install it with `npx skills add BotHarness/dsh-skill`. The monorepo stays canonical: `sync-docs` renders the section from the skill files, and a script machine-publishes the mirror (never hand-edited). Because the content is distilled from upstream research whose claims are pinned to one DSH revision and can be invalidated by upstream fixes, every published page and artifact carries a **Provenance** block — skill version, the DSH version and upstream SHA it was verified against, the verification date, and sources. The docs area is public; the underlying research (with its unverified and license-sensitive claims) stays in-repo.

## Considered Options

- **Subdomain `dsh.botharness.ai` instead of the `/dsh` subroute** — deferred: Nimbus builds canonical URLs and the sitemap from a single `site`, so a subdomain would need a second build or edge rewriting and would split SEO. The subdomain stays reserved as a later 301 if branding ever demands it.
- **Standalone repo as canonical instead of a mirror** — rejected for now: keeping the skill next to the research and our own plugin work means one PR updates skill + research + site; the standalone repo exists only for distribution and external issues. Promote it to canonical only if external contribution demand appears.
- **Publishing the research docs as-is** — rejected: the survey and installation research carry unverified, community-self-reported, and license-sensitive claims; only curated conclusions with sources ship, and the full research stays in the repo.
- **Automated upstream drift detection in v1** — deferred: provenance makes staleness visible, and re-verification is a manual step on DSH releases; a scheduled check can come later.
- **npm package distribution** — rejected: the `skills` CLI installs directly from GitHub, so npm would add a publishing step for no reach.

## Consequences

- Re-verifying `dsh-plugin-dev` is part of adopting a new DSH release; `verifiedAgainst` (DSH version + upstream SHA) is the pin, `verifiedAt` the date, `skillVersion` moves independently.
- The mirror repo is generated output: its README and provenance block come from the synced skill, edits happen only in this monorepo, and its issue template routes reports back here.
- `sync-docs` gains a skill-driven page source for the `dsh/` section; `/zh` gets a hand-written landing while skill-derived pages are marked `untranslated` until reviewed.
- Evidence: `docs/research/2026-09-19-dsh-plugin-authoring-{host,client}.md`, `docs/research/2026-09-19-dsh-community-plugins-survey.md`, `CONTEXT.md` («Developer docs and distribution»).
