# Human Bridge media uses Channel authority and the existing Attachment owner

[#1020](https://github.com/BotHarness/BotHarness/issues/1020) keeps Human media presentation separate from PersonaBot understanding. The first tracer in [#1021](https://github.com/BotHarness/BotHarness/issues/1021) presents Lark native images inside an existing Channel message, while preserving ADR-0107's Source Event and Attachment authorities.

## Trusted content and projection

The application-defined Messaging Provider extends its existing exclusive Consumer with opt-in `source-image-checked` evidence. Lark image and image-bearing native post messages retain the original message ID, authenticated actor/conversation and exact image keys. Post text and image references retain known native order; repeated images share one descriptor and retain each position. Unsupported native mixed elements fail qualification rather than silently dropping content. Platform subscription permissions still decide what can arrive; this change grants no new remote scope.

Messaging validates image capability, resource association, bounded descriptors and content parts before canonical intake. The immutable Source Event remains the sole message-content authority. Realtime and historical Channel projections carry only opaque descriptor IDs, media kinds, display names and ordered text/references. Resource keys stay in trusted Host evidence. Existing placement, sender label and source details remain intact; Inbox-only reception has no Channel media placement.

## Human access

The authenticated DSH API Gateway continues to own the `/api` transport. The existing attachment HTTP route accepts an exact Channel ID, Source Event ID and attachment ID, with no Bot selector. The application-defined Messaging owner resolves current Human Channel access, canonical placement, recorded source reception paths, current routes, identities and grants. The Provider rechecks the original native message and matching resource before acquiring bytes. Model-supplied URLs and resource selectors never become Human media authority.

Ordinary reception stop disables new acquisition through that route. Already acquired bytes remain viewable through a still-valid source authorization. Identity unbind, identity disable, grant revocation, source/placement removal or Channel access loss refuses both new acquisition and cached serving through the affected path. Another independently valid recorded path remains usable; a failed path is never replaced with an unrelated identity. Changes during acquisition or serving cancel/refuse the current operation. A retry may resolve a remaining valid path.

Acquisition reuses the existing Attachment owner and its deterministic provider/fingerprint/conversation/descriptor receipt. Human and existing Bot source-file reads share that identity without adding an Observation, Inbox Admission, model image input or send permission. Completed files reopen after restart. A retained receipt with missing original bytes fails; it does not reacquire and resurrect purged content. Retained content follows the existing Content Purge boundaries; independent downloaded copies cannot be recalled.

## Presentation and bounds

Only visible images request previews. Client and Host each allow at most three concurrent acquisitions, use cancellation and a 25 MiB default bound, and retain no browser resource URL beyond the mounted resource lifetime. The Host serves only sniffed PNG, JPEG, GIF or WebP with `no-store` and `nosniff`; SVG or unrecognized bytes receive an unsupported-preview response. The native DSH Modal supplies enlargement and keyboard/focus behavior. Roster changes invalidate held preview URLs and reload current authorization.

No schema migration, parallel media catalog, remote original editing, autoplay, ASR or extra platform subscription is introduced. Files, audio/video and other providers extend this same presentation contract through subsequent independently validated tracers. Reverting disables future image presentation without deleting canonical Source Events or acquired Attachment files.

## Qualification

Automated tests verify native association/order, exact placement and access, stop/revoke/restart, cancellation, UI visibility/retry and absence of new Inbox/model activity. These are regression evidence, not real platform acceptance. The PR must separately record fresh native-message bytes and actual matched-theme UI evidence; current blockers remain explicit until Human QA completes. Official resource semantics require the original message ID and its matching image key ([Lark reference](https://github.com/larksuite/cli/blob/main/skills/lark-im/references/lark-im-messages-resources-download.md)).
