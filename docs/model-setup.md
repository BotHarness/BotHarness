# Configure API providers and Bot models

Continue from [Install DeepSeekBot](/docs/installation). These controls were checked with DSH **0.2.0-rc.1** and the public **deepseekbot** package. Configure the API provider first, then choose models for each Bot. Multiple Bots can use one provider. Screenshots show the Chinese UI; the captions identify the corresponding controls.

## 1. Configure a provider in DSH

Open **Settings → Models** at the bottom left. Edit an existing provider, or choose **Add model provider**.

- **Third-party provider**: choose a service from the built-in catalog, enter its API key, and save. A key supplied by the launch environment appears read-only and is managed in that environment.
- **Custom model API**: for compatible gateways or self-hosted services, fill in the fields below, add at least one model, and choose **Create provider**.

| Field                                 | Value / purpose                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Provider                              | The actual service from the built-in catalog; selects its adapter and default model catalog.                                            |
| Provider ID                           | A unique custom provider identifier starting with a lowercase letter, such as `acme-gateway`. Routes use this ID, not the display name. |
| Display name                          | Your recognizable name for the provider.                                                                                                |
| API URL                               | The service's base URL, such as the form's `https://gateway.example/v1`. Leave a built-in provider's override empty to use its default. |
| API protocol                          | Match the endpoint: OpenAI Chat Completions, OpenAI Responses, or Anthropic Messages.                                                   |
| API key                               | The service credential. Enter it in DSH's credentials form, not a Bot persona or chat message.                                          |
| Fetch available models                | Retrieve the service's model catalog, if its API and your credentials support this. Otherwise add the documented model ID manually.     |
| Model ID                              | The exact identifier sent to the service.                                                                                               |
| Model display name                    | The readable name in the selector; does not change the ID.                                                                              |
| Model options → Context window        | The model's supported context size; use its specification and a supported format such as `256K`.                                        |
| Model options → Maximum output tokens | The model's output limit, such as `32K`; not a promise of that much output every turn.                                                  |
| Model options → Input types           | Text is required. Enable images only when the model supports them.                                                                      |

![Custom API form and per-model options](/guides/settings/model-provider-custom-zh.webp)

The catalog provider's **Custom settings** override its API URL and model list. With no catalog entries, DSH says the selector will show no models. Bot model presets also need an available catalog entry. Saving the provider alone does not finish Bot model selection.

## 2. Open the target Bot's Model entry

Close Settings, enter **Bot mode**, and open the Bot's DM. In the Channel sidebar on the right, expand **Model** and click the **Main model** card to open the **Model** dialog. See [Model](/docs/channel-sidebar/model) for what each card shows.

![The Model entry in the Bot DM's Channel sidebar](/guides/channel-sidebar/14-model-zh.webp)

This page configures one Bot. Global **Bot settings** contain appearance, sorting, and concurrency options. DSH **Agent presets** choose tools and working style; they are separate from Bot model presets.

## 3. Choose the models and save

Pick models directly in the dialog; no preset is needed.

| Field / action      | Purpose                                                                                                           |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Main model          | The Bot's model for receiving messages, coordinating work, and everyday conversation. Type to filter the list.    |
| Task model          | The default for delegated tasks when no other model is chosen.                                                    |
| Reasoning effort    | An effort supported by the selected model. **Default** leaves it unspecified. Models may offer different options. |
| Allowed task models | Other models a task may pick, and the efforts each one allows.                                                    |
| Save                | Save these settings for this Bot. They apply from the next turn.                                                  |

![The Model dialog opened from the sidebar](/guides/channel-sidebar/15-model-dialog-zh.webp)

After saving, the two sidebar cards show the expected `model · effort`. Each Bot can use a different combination.

## 4. Use presets (optional)

A preset is a reusable set of model settings, handy when several Bots share the same models.

| Action             | Scope                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Save as preset     | Save the dialog's current settings as a new preset and make this Bot use it.            |
| Fill from a preset | Fill the dialog from a saved preset; **Save** applies it to this Bot.                   |
| Change anything    | This Bot is no longer linked to the preset and saves your settings; the preset is kept. |

Task model selection is fixed when the task is created. Changing a default does not reconfigure existing tasks or rerun a response already being generated.

## 5. Verify the actual model

Return to chat and send a short message. After a reply, check **Token usage** in the Bot's Profile (chat header name/avatar → View details), grouped by model or provider. For a specific conversation, open its DSH Session from **Sessions** in the right sidebar and inspect the model selector and next-turn usage record.

![Actual Session model selector and reply after applying the preset](/guides/settings/model-session-verification-zh.webp)

The Bot's saved model settings and an open Session's model selection are separate visible states. For resumed sessions, check the model used by the next turn after saving; a saved label alone is not request verification. Inspect running tasks in their own sessions.

| Symptom                                     | Check                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| “No models are available”                   | Settings → Models: saved provider, working credentials, and catalog entries; then reopen the Model dialog.                      |
| “Current model unavailable” / repair needed | A provider/model may have been renamed or removed. Pick an available model in the Model dialog and save.                        |
| No reply / service error                    | Check URL, protocol, key, model ID, and service quota. Complete a local DM first.                                               |
| Session model differs from the settings     | Inspect that Session's selector and next-turn usage; retain the result for feedback instead of repeatedly editing the settings. |
