# Channel sidebar

The **Channel sidebar** is the right-hand column in **Bot mode**. It follows the selected chat: a PersonaBot DM shows that Bot’s own resources; a local group shows the group’s members and management controls. Opening a native DSH Session takes you to a different, Session-scoped interface.

These pages use DSH **0.2.0-rc.1** and the public **deepseekbot** package. First complete [installation](/docs/installation) and [API and Bot model setup](/docs/model-setup).

## Open the sidebar

1. Enter **Bot mode** and open a Bot DM or a local group in the left roster.
2. If the right column is closed, click **Expand the Channel sidebar** at the right edge.
3. Click an entry’s title to expand or collapse it. Several entries can remain open together.
4. Switch chats to inspect the resources for that Bot or group. Check the chat header before using an action.

## Why an entry may be missing

Bot-only entries do not appear in a group; group management does not appear in a Bot DM. The Bot Inbox entry is conditional on having records or a loading/error state. An entry may also be hidden through **Edit sidebar**.

Optional plugins can contribute further entries. The public npm package does not include the Browser or Computer packages: their absence is expected. When those packages are installed and available, follow [Share a browser tab](/docs/daily-browser) or [Computer export and migration](/docs/computer-export) for their separate prerequisites and procedures. Connecting an IM application is a separate setup flow; after that, External identities and External connectors manage this Bot’s use of it.
