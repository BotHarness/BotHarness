# Bot Inbox

Open **Bot DM → Channel sidebar → Bot Inbox**. This is the selected Bot’s received-source view, including Channel messages and Assignment reports. It differs from **Activity center / Human Inbox**, where you handle requests addressed to you.

## Inspect an item

1. Expand **Bot Inbox**, then expand a source group. Groups can represent a Channel, a task or an external conversation.
2. Read the item summary, author, timestamp and processing state.
3. Click an available source item: Channel messages open the original chat around the message; Assignment reports open the corresponding Session; external items open a source-detail view.
4. Open **Handled or ignored** inside a group to inspect its history. Use **Load more** when offered.

## Read the states correctly

| State             | How to read it                                        |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Pending           | Received and awaiting handling.                       |
| Observed          | Recorded as viewed by the Bot.                        |
| Processing        | The Bot is handling it.                               |
| Deferred          | Handling was deferred.                                |
| Needs repair      | The processing path needs attention.                  |
| Handled / Ignored | Historical items, collapsed into the group’s history. |

The header count excludes handled and ignored records in the loaded view. It is not a count of unread messages for the Human. Opening a source to inspect it is not a manual instruction to mark it handled, and a delivery badge is not proof that the Bot completed your request.

Assignment report labels such as **Progress**, **Completed**, **Blocked**, **Waiting for you** and **Failed** describe the report. A Memory-change item is informational and is not a link to a Channel message. **Source unavailable** means the original source cannot currently be opened.

## When the Inbox is quiet

No records can mean the entry is absent. If it is hidden, restore it in [Display and layout](/docs/channel-sidebar/display). If a message arrived but did not wake the Bot, review the Bot’s source attention settings in [Settings guide](/docs/settings); collection, wake policy and successful model handling are separate checks.

For a request asking you to answer or approve a tool, use its actual action card or **Activity center**. The Bot Inbox sidebar does not replace Human approval. External connection setup remains in the [Lark](/docs/lark-connection) and [Slack](/docs/slack-connection) guides.
