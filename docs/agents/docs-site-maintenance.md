# Docs site maintenance contracts

The docs site combines authored Astro and TypeScript with content generated from repository sources. Code stays comment-free under the [source policy](source-policy.md); Markdown and MDX remain the place for operational and design explanations.

## Content and routes

- `scripts/sync-docs.mjs` builds the English and Chinese content trees, changelog pages, DSH pages, and development reference. Edit their repository sources rather than generated `apps/docs/src/content/**` files. `apps/docs/src/components.ts` registers the MDX components available without local imports.
- English pages live at the root and Chinese counterparts under `/zh/**`. `apps/docs/src/lib/language.ts` owns locale labels, canonical counterpart URLs, and `hreflang` alternates. The `/docs` and `/dev` rails stay scoped to their own sections. Route flags such as `sidebar: false` suppress both the rail and its mobile trigger.
- Clean `/<slug>.md` and `/zh/<slug>.md` siblings expose page content to agents; the older `/index.md` routes remain compatible. The root and Chinese 404 pages are static, while the language-specific page selection happens in the client. OG cards are generated at build time, including Chinese text through the committed Noto Sans SC subset.
- Shared Button and LinkButton variants live in `apps/docs/src/components/ui/button/variants.ts`. A new MDX primitive belongs in `apps/docs/src/components.ts` after its component contract is defined.

## Navigation and client state

- Live docs routes use the Nimbus/Astro sidebar in `apps/docs/src/layouts/DocsLayout.astro` and `apps/docs/src/components/ui/sidebar/`. The desktop tree keeps open groups and scroll position in `sessionStorage`; active links open their ancestor groups. The filter sits above that tree and `/` focuses it. The narrow-screen drawer is a native `<dialog>` with focus, Escape, backdrop, and scroll-lock behavior. Its trigger survives Astro navigation; an open drawer closes before a swapped route can strand focus.
- `apps/docs/src/components/coss/sidebar.tsx` is available as a separate COSS primitive but is not currently mounted by a docs route. Its provider supports controlled or local open state, writes the `sidebar_state` cookie on desktop state changes, uses a mobile sheet below the breakpoint, and handles Ctrl/Meta+B through a callback ref whose cleanup removes the window listener. A future caller that wants cookie restoration must pass the initial open preference.
- The theme preference uses `ui-mode` in `localStorage`; `BaseLayout.astro` applies it before paint, while the toggle handles user actions. Package-manager tabs use `ui-pm-tab` in `sessionStorage` and restore before paint. Search, TOC, tabs, collapsibles, and dialogs use their `*.client.ts` controllers; controllers must clean up listeners and observers when Astro swaps a page. Search remains scoped to the page locale and section.

## Styling and diagrams

- `apps/docs/src/styles/globals.css` defines Nimbus `--nb-*` tokens, maps them into Tailwind utilities, then provides COSS semantic aliases that point back to Nimbus values. Keep this docs-site COSS system separate from the in-harness DSH token choice in [ADR-0028](../adr/0028-in-harness-ui-uses-dsh-design-system.md).
- `prose.css` styles classless Markdown content while leaving component-owned markup alone. Wide tables scroll inside `.nb-table-scroll`; Shiki blocks, focus states, and mobile navigation take their tokens from `globals.css`. `mermaid.css` reserves compact space before rendering, and `apps/docs/src/scripts/mermaid.ts` loads the large Mermaid bundle only when needed.
- After changing authored docs-site code, run `corepack pnpm --filter docs typecheck` and `corepack pnpm --filter docs build`. Exercise a long docs page on desktop and a narrow viewport: open and close the rail, use its filter and route links, toggle the drawer by pointer and keyboard, and repeat in light and dark themes.
