# Packaged product with IM

The repository is still a source preview. The commands below build and test real
npm tarballs locally; they do not publish packages or claim that a public product
release exists. See [ADR-0127](adr/0127-product-artifacts-compose-an-independently-versioned-im-provider.md)
for the distribution decision and [#823](https://github.com/BotHarness/BotHarness/issues/823)
for the current qualification and Human QA evidence.

## What the product installs

One `deepseekbot` product Bundle composes Core, Client and a pinned,
independently versioned `@botharness/im-provider`. The Provider is maintained from
[dsh-im](https://github.com/xmanrui/dsh-im) and ships its upstream license and
provenance. Users of the qualified product do not separately install a Git fork,
Lark SDK, or Human `lark-cli`. Credentials and connections remain with the Provider.

Installation leaves every account disconnected. In native Settings → IM bots,
choose the platform and connect its application identity. In the PersonaBot
Profile, bind that identity and explicitly authorize a saved test group. External
identities and Channel connectors have separate tables; merely installing or
binding an identity does not mirror messages into a local DM. The initial policy
is @mention-only to Bot Inbox. Test an actual @mention and compare the original
Lark topic reply with canonical source/Outbox details; Lark read indicators do not
prove Bot receipt. First-time guided setup is the separate #824 tracer.

## Maintainer: build the distribution artifacts

Use Node ≥22, the repository's pnpm version, and its pinned DSH `0.2.0-rc.1`.
Keep the Provider input outside the product workspace. Its immutable input
includes compiled runtime, source manifest and package lock; an unexpected input
fails before packing.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DoodleBears/dsh-im.git /tmp/bh-im-source
git -C /tmp/bh-im-source checkout b442da91b267412e84a4d18224adc30777024862
npm ci --prefix /tmp/bh-im-source --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm build
node scripts/product-artifacts.mjs \
  --provider-source /tmp/bh-im-source \
  --output /tmp/bh-product-artifacts \
  --version 0.0.0-test.823
```

Choose a fresh output directory. `artifacts.json` records the four actual tarballs,
exact versions, DSH revision and integrity. The test SemVer is for local
qualification only. Provider changes require their own version increment and
new behavioral qualification; do not silently replace the same published version.

## Verify an empty Profile

```bash
node scripts/dev-instance.mjs \
  --home /tmp/bh-product-qa \
  --port 32615 \
  --product-artifacts /tmp/bh-product-artifacts \
  --json
```

The helper installs an official fixed CLI in that task-owned home, verifies
tarball integrity and installed Provider runtime, and probes the authenticated
BotHarness API. Open its private login URL locally; never publish that URL or
raw credential logs. Plugins → deepseekbot must show the selected test version
and **three running components**. Settings → IM bots must show the scoped
Provider version and **Updates with BotHarness**, with no connected accounts.

This is a real package install with local tarball substitutions for versions not
yet on npm. It uses no Provider Git dependency or local source link in the Profile.
After an independently authorized registry release, a normal native product
installation resolves those exact dependencies from npm without the local
substitution inventory. Registry publication is a separate release action.

## Restart, upgrade and conflicts

Stop only the PID returned by this task's helper. Restart with the same home and
artifact directory; verify the real model and source-bound receiver again. For a
representative upgrade, pack a new product test version into a new directory,
stop that Host and pass the new directory while retaining the home. The installer
preserves unrelated workspace/build settings, account state and canonical data.

If the Profile separately enables `@xmanrui/dsh-im`, `@botharness/im-provider`,
`@botharness/core` or `@botharness/ui`, the helper refuses and names the offending
Bundle. Stop its owning Host and remove only that duplicate Bundle entry before
retrying. Keep the stored credentials, account settings and source/Outbox history.
An incompatible Provider replacement requires requalification, not a version
exemption or a second receiver. No restart/upgrade should backfill remote history
or blindly repeat an unknown send. Apply the existing database backup/forward
recovery rules before any retained Profile downgrade.
