# @botharness/links-worker

`go.botharness.ai`: the Campaign short link Worker ([ADR-0132](../../docs/adr/0132-anonymous-posthog-telemetry-and-campaign-short-links.md), [#953](https://github.com/BotHarness/BotHarness/issues/953)). A **Campaign** owns many **Campaign Links** (see `CONTEXT.md`). Resolving a link redirects to the product site with UTM parameters, counts the click in D1 and sends a server-side `link_clicked` event to PostHog. It is a Hono app built with `@hono/zod-openapi`; the API is defined once and published as `/openapi.json`.

## Redirect

`GET /{slug}` answers `302` with `Cache-Control: no-store`:

- **Language.** A link stores the Chinese (default) site path and a `language`. `zh` opens the path as is; `en` opens it under `/en`: path `/docs/overview/` with `en` goes to `/en/docs/overview/`, path `/` with `en` goes to `/en/`. Paths that already start with `/en` are refused so the prefix is never doubled.
- **Not an open redirect.** The origin is fixed in code. A path must start with a single `/` and use only `A-Z a-z 0-9 - . _ ~ / %` (no query, fragment, `..` segment or `//` prefix), and the built URL is checked to stay on `deepseekbot.botharness.ai`.
- **Slugs** of Campaigns and links: lowercase letters, digits and hyphens, 1–64 characters, not starting or ending with a hyphen, unique, fixed after creation. `v1`, `v2`, `mcp`, `admin`, `api`, `health` and `openapi` are reserved. Request slugs are matched case-insensitively.
- **Generated slugs.** A link created without a `slug` gets `<platform>-<media>` (`_` becomes `-`), or the first free `-2`, `-3`… up to `-100` when that is taken, so `utm_content` stays readable. The admin page prefills a Campaign's slug from its name.
- **Platform** and **media** are free labels (lowercase letters, digits, `-`, `_`, 1–32 characters) so new channels need no deploy. Suggested values: platforms `bilibili`, `x`, `youtube`, `producthunt`, `xiaohongshu`, `zhihu`, `wechat`, `github`, `hackernews`, `reddit`; media `video`, `post`, `launch`, `article`, `thread`, `comment`.
- **Archived** links and Campaigns keep their rows and counts but no longer carry UTMs, so an old post still lands on the site without crediting a closed Campaign.

## Click capture

Counting and the PostHog event run in `waitUntil` after the response, so a D1 write failure or a PostHog outage never blocks or breaks the redirect. D1 keeps a total and a per-UTC-day counter per link; no IP address, user agent or referrer is stored.

Link previewers and crawlers (Twitterbot, facebookexternalhit, Slackbot, Discordbot, TelegramBot, WhatsApp, LinkedInBot, Googlebot, bingbot, Applebot, Embedly, redditbot, Bytespider and any `User-Agent` with a `bot` word, `bot/`, `crawler`, `spider` or `preview`) get the same redirect with UTMs but are neither counted nor sent as `link_clicked`. In-app browsers such as WeChat (`MicroMessenger`) count as people. The `User-Agent` is only matched in memory; it is never stored or sent.

The event goes to `POST {POSTHOG_HOST}/i/v0/e/`:

```json
{
  "api_key": "<POSTHOG_KEY>",
  "event": "link_clicked",
  "distinct_id": "<random UUID per click>",
  "properties": {
    "source": "links",
    "campaign": "ph-launch",
    "link": "ph-x-post",
    "platform": "x",
    "media": "post",
    "language": "en",
    "$process_person_profile": false,
    "$geoip_disable": true
  }
}
```

`$process_person_profile: false` keeps clicks out of person profiles; `$geoip_disable` stops PostHog from geolocating the Worker's own egress address. The click is recorded even when the visitor blocks the site's script; the site's pageview then carries the same UTMs for funnels.

## API (`/v1`)

Every `/v1` route needs `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. `GET` routes need a `read` or `write` token; every other route needs `write`. Errors are `{ "error": { "code": "…" } }` (`unauthorized` 401, `insufficient-scope` 403, `invalid-request` 400 with `issues`, `*-not-found` 404, `*-slug-taken` and `campaign-archived` 409). The full contract is `GET /openapi.json`.

## Personal Access Tokens

- A token is `bhl_` followed by 43 base64url characters (32 random bytes). The first 12 characters are stored as `prefix` so a leaked token can be recognized in the list and in secret scanners.
- Only the SHA-256 hash is stored. The plaintext appears once, in the `POST /v1/tokens` response.
- `read` tokens can call every `GET` route. `write` tokens can do everything, including token management.
- `expiresInDays` defaults to 90; `null` creates a token that never expires. Expired and revoked tokens get `401`. `lastUsedAt` is updated at most once an hour.
- **Bootstrap.** The `LINKS_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN` secret works as a bearer token for `/v1/tokens` routes only (create, list, revoke), and gets `403 bootstrap-token-only-manages-tokens` elsewhere. It must be at least 32 characters and is compared in constant time. It exists only to get started before the admin page is reachable. Delete it with `npx wrangler secret delete LINKS_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN` after the first successful admin login; from then on tokens are created and revoked on the admin page.

## MCP (`/mcp`)

The Worker serves a Streamable HTTP MCP server at `POST /mcp` ([#955](https://github.com/BotHarness/BotHarness/issues/955)) for agents such as Claude Code. It is stateless and answers with JSON (a fresh `McpServer` and the SDK's `WebStandardStreamableHTTPServerTransport` per request); `GET` and `DELETE` get `405`.

- **Auth.** `Authorization: Bearer <PAT>` with the same token check as `/v1`; a missing, unknown, expired or revoked token gets `401` with `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer`. The bootstrap secret does not work here.
- **Tools.** Read tools work with a `read` or `write` token; the others need `write` and answer a `read` token with a tool error `{ "status": 403, "error": { "code": "insufficient-scope" } }`. Tools take the same zod schemas as `/v1` and call the same `src/operations.ts`, so validation and errors match the API (`{ status, error: { code } }` as a tool error).

| Tool                                                                          | Scope | Same as                             |

| `link_clicks` `{ slug, days? }`                                               | read  | `GET /v1/links/{slug}/clicks`       |

Link results carry `shortUrl` (`https://go.botharness.ai/<slug>`) and `target`, the site URL with the four UTMs. Add the server to Claude Code with a PAT from the admin page:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http botharness-links https://go.botharness.ai/mcp --header "Authorization: Bearer $BH_LINKS_TOKEN"
```

claude.ai web connectors need OAuth, which is the second phase (ADR-0132). For the command line, use [`bh-links`](../links-cli/README.md).

## Admin page (`/admin`)

A server-rendered page (Hono `html` templates, no frontend build) for Humans, behind Cloudflare Access. It calls the same operations as `/v1` (`src/operations.ts`), so validation and rules are identical.

- `/admin`: Campaigns with link and click totals (archived ones on request), a New campaign form, the Personal Access Token list (prefix, scope, expiry, last use, status) with Revoke, and a Create token form. A new token is shown once, with a Copy button, on the response to the create form (`Cache-Control: no-store`); afterwards only its prefix is visible.
- `/admin/campaigns/{slug}`: once the Campaign has clicks, two charts rendered to SVG on the server with [TanStack Charts](https://tanstack.com/charts) (clicks per day over the last 30 UTC days stacked by platform, and total clicks by link), then the Campaign's links with the short URL and a Copy button, platform, media, target, total clicks, the last 7 UTC days as small bars, last click, inline Edit and Archive; a New link form; and the Campaign's name, description and Archive.
- Form posts redirect back with a message (`303`). Cross-site posts are refused with `403` by Hono's `csrf` middleware (`Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin` or an `Origin` of `https://go.botharness.ai`). Pages send `Cache-Control: no-store`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY` and a CSP that allows only the page's own `/admin/admin.js` (copy buttons and confirmations).

### Access verification

Cloudflare Access puts a signed JWT in the `Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion` header of every request it lets through. The Worker verifies it with Hono's JWT helper (`Jwt.verifyWithJwks`, RS256 only) against `https://<ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN>/cdn-cgi/access/certs`, which it caches for an hour per isolate and refetches once when a token does not verify against keys older than a minute (key rotation). The issuer must be `https://<ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN>`, the audience must contain `ACCESS_AUD`, `exp`/`nbf`/`iat` must hold and the payload must carry an `email`, which the page shows as the signed-in user. No header gives `401`, an invalid token `403`, and missing `ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN` or `ACCESS_AUD` `503`. PATs and the bootstrap secret are never accepted here, and the `/v1` API never accepts an Access JWT.

Local development has no Access. Set `ADMIN_DEV_EMAIL=you@example.com` in `.dev.vars` to open the page as that e-mail. The bypass is honored only while `ACCESS_AUD` is empty, so it cannot apply to a deployment where Access is configured; never set it in `wrangler.jsonc` or as a production secret.

### Cloudflare Access setup

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard open **Zero Trust**. Its **Settings** page shows the **team domain**, `<team>.cloudflareaccess.com`.
2. **Access → Applications → Add an application → Self-hosted**. Name it `BotHarness links admin`, session duration 24 hours, and add the public hostname `go.botharness.ai` with path `admin*` (this covers `/admin` and `/admin/...`; leave the redirect `/<slug>`, `/v1` and `/openapi.json` unprotected).
3. Add a policy: action **Allow**, include **Emails** with the maintainers' addresses (or an **Emails ending in** rule for the team domain). Use the default identity provider (one-time PIN by e-mail) or the team's GitHub/Google login.
4. Save, then open the application's **Overview** (or **Basic information**) and copy the **Application Audience (AUD) Tag**.
5. Put both values in `wrangler.jsonc` and deploy:

   ```jsonc
   "ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN": "<team>.cloudflareaccess.com",
   "ACCESS_AUD": "<application AUD tag>",
   ```

6. Open `https://go.botharness.ai/admin`, sign in, create a write token, and delete the bootstrap secret (`npx wrangler secret delete LINKS_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN`).

## Known limits

- Campaign and link slugs, and a link's Campaign, cannot change after creation; create a new link instead.
- Archiving cannot be undone through the API (there is no restore route).
- List routes return everything in one response, without pagination; fine for the expected tens to hundreds of links.
- Previewer filtering is a `User-Agent` match, so a previewer that pretends to be a browser is still counted.

## Configuration

| Name                    | Kind             | Use                                                                                            |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `LINKS_DB`              | D1               | Campaigns, links, daily click counters and token hashes (`migrations/`)                        |
| `LINKS_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN` | secret           | Bootstrap bearer for `/v1/tokens`; unset or shorter than 32 characters disables it             |
| `POSTHOG_HOST`          | var              | Capture host, default `https://us.i.posthog.com`; empty disables the event                     |
| `POSTHOG_KEY`           | var              | PostHog project API key (public by design); empty disables the event                           |
| `ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN`    | var              | Zero Trust team domain, `<team>.cloudflareaccess.com`; the admin page answers `503` without it |
| `ACCESS_AUD`            | var              | Audience tag of the Access application protecting `/admin*`                                    |
| `ADMIN_DEV_EMAIL`       | `.dev.vars` only | Local admin without Access; ignored whenever `ACCESS_AUD` is set                               |

The event goes straight to PostHog US rather than through `t.botharness.ai`: a server-side call is not affected by ad blockers, and a Worker fetching another Worker's custom domain on the same zone is not routed through that Worker without extra configuration.

## Local development

```bash
cd packages/links
printf 'LINKS_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN=%s\n' "$(node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64url'))")" > .dev.vars
pnpm db:migrate:local
pnpm dev
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8787/v1/tokens \
  -H "authorization: Bearer $(grep LINKS_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN .dev.vars | cut -d= -f2)" \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"name":"local","scope":"write"}'

Add `ADMIN_DEV_EMAIL=you@example.com` to `.dev.vars` and open `http://127.0.0.1:8787/admin` for the admin page. Add `POSTHOG_HOST=http://127.0.0.1:<port>` to `.dev.vars` to capture events locally instead of sending them to PostHog. Tests run with the workspace `pnpm test` against an in-memory SQLite D1.

## Deploy

Production deployment is a separate, explicitly authorized step. With `wrangler login` on the botharness.ai account, from `packages/links`:

The D1 database `botharness-links` (APAC) was created on 2026-10-06 and its `database_id` is in `wrangler.jsonc`. To recreate it elsewhere, run `npx wrangler d1 create botharness-links` and put the printed `database_id` into `wrangler.jsonc`.

1. Apply the schema and deploy; the `routes` entry attaches the custom domain `go.botharness.ai` (the `botharness.ai` zone is on the same account):

   ```bash
   npx wrangler d1 migrations apply LINKS_DB --remote
   pnpm --filter @botharness/links-worker run deploy
   ```

2. Set the bootstrap secret and keep the generated value in the team password manager:

   ```bash
   node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64url'))" | npx wrangler secret put LINKS_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN
   ```

3. Set up Cloudflare Access for `/admin*` and fill `ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN` and `ACCESS_AUD` (see [Cloudflare Access setup](#cloudflare-access-setup)), then deploy again.
4. Sign in at `https://go.botharness.ai/admin`, create a Campaign with two links and a `write` PAT, and delete the bootstrap secret. Use the PAT against the API (for example `curl -H "authorization: Bearer $PAT" https://go.botharness.ai/v1/campaigns`), then create a link with it, and open `https://go.botharness.ai/<slug>`. Check that the site's `$pageview` in PostHog carries the four UTMs and that `link_clicked` arrives with the site script blocked.
