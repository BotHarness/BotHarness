# Channel sidebar guide screenshots

Captured from the real native UI in an isolated DSH 0.2.0-rc.1 public-web Profile with deepseekbot@0.1.0-alpha.1. Screenshots use the Chinese interface at a 1230 × 820 viewport; the English guide identifies the equivalent controls. The WebP files are format conversions of native browser captures, with no reconstructed UI.

The example Bots and local channel were created for documentation. A real model reply saved `sidebar-demo.md` with the native file tool; the working diff shows that uncommitted file. The commit view shows the repository's actual initialization commit, not a fabricated Bot checkpoint. The second Bot supplied a real reply and handled Inbox record. The local group invitation was accepted under the Profile's automatic acceptance setting.

Reading files/diffs, opening Sessions and returning to the chat, locating an Inbox source, inspecting group/member controls, and cancelling a sidebar visibility draft were exercised. Folder grants, broader execution permissions, restore/repair, branch switching, member removal and disbanding were not applied. Their descriptions were checked against the implementation and distinguish requests, confirmation and resulting state.

Website comparison captures use base `5969d5bb25f10c702952bb4114dc6e4efc2ae635` (336 pages, Quickstart entry point without the chapter) and the synchronized guide revision `804c1e952b5b73f7528b814765b3560ea3928d11` (352 pages). Desktop pairs match Chinese locale and 1230 × 820 light/dark states; the mobile pair matches 390 × 844 light state. The seven subpages have no predecessor and share the baseline Quickstart entry point.

`12-schedules-zh.webp` and `13-schedule-dialog-zh.webp` (Schedules guide, #962) were captured the same way at 1230 × 820 in an isolated DSH 0.2.0-rc.1 Profile running the #962 branch, with schedules seeded through the BotHarness core store. The weekly schedule's **Manual** firing comes from a real Run now.

`14-model-zh.webp`, `15-model-dialog-zh.webp`, `16-wake-policy-zh.webp` and `17-wake-policy-dialog-zh.webp` (Model and Wake policy guides, #1084) were captured the same way at 1230 × 820 in an isolated DSH 0.2.0-rc.1 Profile running the #1084 branch. The preset and the ordinary Group digest rule were set through the same bridge methods the sidebar calls.
